Who Was Moses?

What comes to mind when you hear the name Moses? Do you think of . . .

the baby whose mother hid him in a basket in the Nile River?

the boy who was raised in luxury in Egypt by the daughter of Pharaoh​—yet never forgot that he was an Israelite?

the man who lived as a shepherd in Midian for 40 years?

the man who had a conversation with Jehovah * in front of a burning bush?

the man who stood up to the king of Egypt, boldly asking for the Israelites to be freed from slavery?

the man who, at God’s direction, announced the Ten Plagues upon Egypt when its king defied the true God?

the man who led the Israelites in a grand exodus from Egypt?

the man who was used in the parting of the Red Sea?

the man who gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments from God?

MOSES had all those experiences and more. No wonder this faithful man is highly respected by Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike!

Without question, Moses was a prophet who showed “great awesomeness.” (Deuteronomy 34:10-12) He allowed God to use him in a mighty way. Yet, Moses was an ordinary human. Just like the prophet Elijah, who appeared beside Moses in a vision during Jesus’ earthly ministry, Moses was a man “with feelings like ours.” (James 5:17; Matthew 17:1-9) Moses faced many of the same problems that we encounter, and he overcame them successfully.

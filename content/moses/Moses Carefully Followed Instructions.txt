Moses conscientiously followed Jehovah’s detailed instructions for the construction and setting up of the tabernacle. We should likewise listen to any instructions we receive from Jehovah’s organization and obey promptly and wholeheartedly. This is true even if it does not seem important to follow them or we do not understand the reason for the instructions.​—Lu 16:10.

Why should we listen to and carefully follow instructions . . .

during meetings for field service?

regarding preparing for medical emergencies?

about disaster preparedness?

The following two pieces of content describe the same code module in our Clinical Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) automation repository. Integrate the content, considering both old and new relationships, and extract the following information:

- Module Identification:
  - Source code path
  - Full namespace

- Overall Purpose: Describe the module's role in automating RCM tasks through Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

- Services Provided: Outline the services the module offers within the overall repository.

- Relationships with Other Modules: Reference other modules by their respective full path and/or full namespace.

Return only the merged description.

### Example Input:

Old description: Module A handles data extraction.

New description: Module A now also handles data transformation.

### Example Output:

Module A (`src/path/to/module_a.py`, namespace `package.module_a`) handles data extraction and transformation as part of automating RCM tasks through RPA. It provides services related to data processing and interacts with Module B (`src/path/to/module_b.py`, namespace `package.module_b`).
